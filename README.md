# Decryption

This is the second application to the enforcing privacy with crytography projects for decrypting the code

**Enforcing Privacy with Cryptography**

This is the second application to the enforcing privacy with crytography projects.
This application is similar to the first were it checks if the input is valid first before
sending it to be decrypt. This app reverses the encryption scheme and prints out the original 4 digit integer.

example:
4 digit to encrypt: 1234
encryption code: 0189
decrypted code: 1234
